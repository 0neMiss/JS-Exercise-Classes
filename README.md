## Get Started

Two options are included below. The CodeSandbox option is fast & highly recommended.

<summary>1. Using Code Sandbox</summary>

* Launch the sandbox using the link below.
* Sign into Code Sandbox.
* Fork the sandbox.
* See your tests running on the "Browser" tab (NOT the "Tests" tab).
* The way you'll submit your work will be by pasting your fork's URL into the submission form.

  <summary>2. Using VSCode and the Command Line</summary>

  1. Fork repo and add TL as collaborator on Github.
  1. Clone _your_ fork (not Lambda's repo by mistake!).
  1. `cd` into your newly cloned repository.
  1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`.
  1. Install dependencies using npm.
  1. Run the test:watch command.
  1. Work on your branch, push commits and create PR as usual.

  ```sh
    git clone <insert your git clone url here>
    cd <repo folder name>
    npm install
    npm run test:watch
  ```
