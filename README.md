* [Get Started](#get-started)

## Instructions

Find the file `index.js` and complete tasks 1, 2 and 3 until all of your tests pass.
There is an additional task 4 which requires written explanations and has no test.

## Get Started

Three options are included below. The CodeSandbox option is fast & highly recommended.

**1. Using Code Sandbox**

* Fork the sandbox. Submit your project by pasting the link to your fork in the submission form.
* See your tests running on the "Browser" tab, NOT the "Tests" tab
